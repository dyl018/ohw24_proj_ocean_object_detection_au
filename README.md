## Ocean Object Detection Using Sentinel-2

## One-line Description
Python tools to detect floating debris (of any kind) in the ocean using Sentinel-2 imagery.

## Collaborators
Cowley, D., Ginting, D.

## Background
Detecting and tracking marine debris is useful for a variety of applications. This project is attempting to identify marine floating objects and then classify them based on surface reflectance.

## Goals
The main goals of this project are to provide updated tools for locating different types of objects on the surface of the sea. This involves a few key steps:
1. Acquiring satellite imagery via Python.
2. Applying object detection indices (e.g., NDVI, FDI).
3. Classification of marine objects using machine learning techniques.
4. Visualisation of objects.

## Datasets
Sentinel-2 imagery is used.
