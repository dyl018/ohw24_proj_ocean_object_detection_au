# ohw24_proj_ocean_object_detection_au

## Project Name
Ocean Object Detection Using Sentinel-2

## One-line Description
Create some user friendly, modular tools in both Python and R to detect what's on the ocean surface using Sentinel-2 imagery.

## Collaborators
Cowley, D., Ginting, D.

## Background
Detecting marine objects is useful for a variety of applications and there are many tools. This project is attempting to identify these objects at a selected location and produce usable output for further analysis, utilising a combination of existing tools and packages for multiple programming languages.

## Goals
The main goals of this project are to provide updated tools for locating different types of objects on the surface of the sea. This involves a few key steps:
1. Acquiring satellite imagery at a user defined location for a specific time.
2. Applying object detection indices (e.g., NDVI, FDI) to identify objects in the water.
3. Produce summary statistics for object coverage and type.
4. Create output usable in GIS.

## Datasets
Sentinel-2 imagery from the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/).
