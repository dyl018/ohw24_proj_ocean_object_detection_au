## Project Name
Ocean Object Detection Using Sentinel-2

## One-line Description
Create some friendly tools to detect what's on the ocean surface using Sentinel-2 imagery.

## Collaborators
Cowley, D., Ginting, D.

## Background
Detecting marine objects is useful for a variety of applications. This project is attempting to identify these objects at any selected location and then classify them based on surface reflectance.

## Goals
The main goals of this project are to provide updated tools for locating different types of objects on the surface of the sea. This involves a few key steps:
1. Acquiring satellite imagery at a user defined location for a specific time.
2. Applying object detection indices (e.g., NDVI, FDI) to identify objects in the water.
3. Produce summary statistics for object coverage and type.
4. Create output usable in GIS.

## Datasets
Sentinel-2 imagery is used.
